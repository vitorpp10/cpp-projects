## focus: transition and fundamentals

this month's main goal was to migrate from a high-level workflow to system development in c++, focusing on terminal tools and performance-driven logic.

## projects

- **01-simple-login-system**:
    - **topics**: `std::string`, `while (true)`, `control flow`, `g++ compilation`.
    - **goal**: create a gatekeeper with attempt limits and handling of infinite loops.

- **02-reverse-array**:
    - **topics**: `pointer arithmetic`, `in-place memory manipulation`, `vconverging pointers strategy`, `vvspatial complexity o(1)`, `g++ toolchain`.
    - **goal**: implement a high-performance array reversal algorithm by manipulating raw memory addresses directly, avoiding heap allocation or auxiliary buffers to simulate low-latency data processing.

- **03-coming-soon**:
    - **topics**: awaiting next goal.

- **04-coming-soon**:
    - **topics**: awaiting next goal.

## tools mastered

- **neovim**: basic navigation and insert/command modes.
- **tmux**: window management for compile/run cycle.
- **linux**: directory and permissions manipulation via terminal.
