# cpp-labs

## overview

this repository is my central hub for training and growth in c++. the goal here is to build a solid foundation in systems engineering and low-latency programming through deliberate and constant practice.

## structure

the project is organized chronologically to document my technical progress. the structure follows a continuous learning roadmap:

- **frequency**: 4 projects/labs per month.

- **organization**: each monthly directory contains four specific challenges exploring different areas of c++ and the linux ecosystem.

- **goal**: shift focus entirely from high-level languages (python) to full control over hardware and performance (c++).

## technical stack

- **editor**: neovim (keyboard-focused workflow).

- **multiplexer**: tmux (session and window management).

- **compiler**: g++ (focus on optimization and debug flags).

- **environment**: linux terminal.

## roadmap

the labs cover everything from control flow logic and primitive types to advanced topics like:

- memory management (pointers & references).
  
- data structures & algorithms.

- linux internals & systems programming.

- low-latency optimization.

each project here is a proof of work on the path to 8,000 hours of expertise in high-performance systems.
